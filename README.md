# Red Line Guerilla

## Aahaar  Deluxe

### What?
I made a other version of [I'm an inline-style link](http://www.aahaar.com/)
I used html & css with a little bit of bootstrap

##### A chronologically list what I did

1. Background, a photo.
2. Navigation bar in Bootstrap whit a list of home, about, menu, services and contact. 
3. H1() & H3().
4. a button
=> H1 & H3 and the button are in the middle of the page.
5. the last step was a toolbar with adress, tel, email and opening hours.

because my lack of knowledge everything is basic, no SASS and a little bit of bootstrap. With the result that my document isn't responsive.
